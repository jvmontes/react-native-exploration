# react-native-exploration
This project will contain documentation, links, and references to projects using React Native.

## But First, An Introduction
Hi, my name is Jorge Viramontes. I've served as an iOS developer for over 5 years as a software consultant. I've also had experience developing web applications using Angular built on top of Typescript. The purpose of this project is to document any findings as I explore how to use React Native to build iOS and Android applications. I will explore and leverage various APIs, SDKs, and other tools to quickly build valuable features. I hope you find this valuable and insightful as you progress along your own coding journey.

## Practical Adivce for the Newbie

My journey started with a simple Google search: "How to write iOS apps using React Native." Here's my advice on how to learn any new development tool.

#### **Find the documentation of the tool.** 
The internet is a wide world out there. But sometimes the simplest solutions are provided to you by the people who worked on the product themselves. Many development frameworks will contain a "Getting Started" guide, "Quick Start" guide, tutorials, or extensive documentation of their API. I would highly recommend spending time with the resources they provide and explore what the existing community provides. 

#### **Try everything.** 
Here's a secret that not many developers will tell you: coding is just a whole bunch of searching on Google and following tutorials, or finding a solution on StackOverflow that fits your needs. The more practice and experience you get, the more comfortable and confident you will become as you gain experience using different debugging techniques and get the results you ultimately expect. It's a giant game of **experiment, fail, learn, iterate.** 

#### **Understand the foundation.** 
While it's important to try everything to get your software to work, it's a lot smarter to try everything once you understand how the underlying mechanism works. Before getting started, it is important to have a foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms and the language you are using. JavaScript is a powerfully simple language that is used in a myriad of ways by various frameworks and libraries, React Native included. 

To jump right in to development without understanding how JavaScript functions under-the-hood will leave you in a constant game of catch up, uncertain about what's going on. I _highly_ recommend checking out [this course on JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/understand-javascript/). The instructor goes into details on some of the most complex parts of JavaScript such as runtime and execution time, function scope, etc., and explains it in a digestable easy-to-understand way.

Okay, okay, okay. Enough chit-chat. Let's get down to the nitty gritty.

## What You'll Need

#### **Hardware** 
I work using a MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2016). This is the only piece of hardware you will need to build applications using React Native. Having an actual mobile device for testing is a nice-to-have but not necessary, as there are emulators that allow you to run your mobile app on your machine. 

#### **Terminal** 
If you're not familiar with Git & the terminal, I highly recommend use learn your way around that first, as it makes your development process faster and, frankly, you just look much cooler working out of a terminal. It's like you're going into the matrix. A simple Google search for "Mac terminal basic commands" yields fruitful results, such as this [tutsplus article](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/command-line-basics-and-useful-tricks-with-the-terminal--cms-29356).
